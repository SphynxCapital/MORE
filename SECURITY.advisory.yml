description: |
  This advisory outlines supported versions, Gemini/Google Labs API integration security boundaries, GitHub workflow controls, and reporting/triage timelines for any vulnerabilities discovered in the AI-assisted application framework.

  Users running versions older than 4.0 or between 5.0.x and 5.1.x are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately.

  Gemini-based inference systems must follow sandbox policies. OAuth2-protected API secrets and output data handling are secured using project-level encryption and commit-based access audit trails.

solutions:
  - Upgrade to version 5.1.x or higher.
  - Enable auto-commit protection and key rotation for GitHub-linked pipelines.
  - Report any suspicious inference behavior through official disclosure channels.

tools:
  - Google Gemini API
  - Vertex AI
  - GitHub Actions
  - Google Drive OAuth integrations
