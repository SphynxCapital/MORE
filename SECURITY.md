## 🤖 Gemini & Google Labs AI Integrations

This project supports integrations with:

- Gemini API (Pro / Vision / 1.5+)
- Google Labs tools (Vertex AI, MakerSuite, Model Garden)
- Google Drive / OAuth-secured environments

All data processed through these services adheres to internal security protocols and is sandboxed for protection. API keys and secrets are encrypted at rest and obfuscated in transmission.

---

## 🔁 GitHub Integration

The AI system supports automatic output saving and commit functionality to GitHub. This includes:

- Secure GitHub OAuth2 connection
- `Save to GitHub` buttons from within the platform
- Commit of `.md`, `.json`, `.py`, `.ts`, and custom assets into your repository
- Branch protection and commit signing (optional)

### How to Use:
1. Link your GitHub account via the platform UI or API.
2. Authorize required scopes (repo, workflow).
3. Outputs will appear under `/gemini-results/` with timestamped folders.

---

## ✅ After Project Completion

Upon finalization of any Gemini-powered job or lab inference:

- Results are shown in a downloadable report summary.
- All outputs can be saved to GitHub, exported as Markdown or PDF.
- A full audit trail is maintained for every commit, including model version, user ID, and payload hash.

To automate this process, enable the `auto-commit` flag or trigger via Gemini batch mode using the `commit=true` flag in JSONL requests.

## 📣 Final Notes

We are committed to continuous security hardening across all AI pipelines, from inference to storage. Community contributions and disclosures are welcomed and rewarded via our private bounty program (invite-only).

Thank you for helping keep the AI ecosystem safe.
